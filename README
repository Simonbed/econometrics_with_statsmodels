This is just to show how to proceed with doing some statistic tests on regressions and different regressions. 

The results of these regressions have not been analysed. I could take the time to interpret the results but it would 
take more time and I don't want to give wrong interpretations of the results. 

The 3 csv files come from the us federal reserve website. 

Have fun looking at how to do the tests.
